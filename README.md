# Feature Breakdown 

1. User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management. <br>
2. Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval. <br>
3. Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details. <br>
4. Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details. <br>
5. Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties. <br>
6. Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations. <br>

# API Security 

<h2> Key Security Measures that will be Implemented: </h2> <br>

1. Authentication: Knowing Who's Who <br>
This is the process of verifying the identity of a user or service trying to access your application. Without proper authentication, anyone could pretend to be anyone else. <br>
2. Authorization: What Can They Do? <br>
Once a user is authenticated (you know who they are), authorization determines what actions that user is permitted to perform and what resources they can access. <br>
3. Rate Limiting: Preventing Abuse <br>
Rate limiting controls the number of requests a user or IP address can make to your server within a given timeframe. This is crucial for preventing various types of attacks and ensuring fair usage. <br>
4. Input Validation & Data Sanitization <br>
While not strictly a "security measure" in the same vein as authentication, these are fundamental to preventing a host of vulnerabilities: <br>
5. Secure Communication (HTTPS) <br>
6. Error Handling & Logging <br>

<h2> Why Security is Crucial for Each Key Area of the Project: </h2> <br>

1. Protecting User Data (Profiles, Messages, Preferences): <br>
2. Securing Payments (Booking Transactions, Financial Information): <br>
3. Ensuring Data Integrity (Listing Details, Booking Statuses, Reviews): <br>
4. Maintaining Platform Availability (Uptime, Performance): <br>
5. Preventing Fraud (Fake Listings, Scam Bookings, Account Takeovers): <br>
6. Protecting Business Logic & Intellectual Property: <br>

# CI/CD Pipeline 

CI/CD pipelines are essential practices in modern software development that automate stages of the software delivery process. They are incredibly important for a complex project like the Airbnb clone because they streamline development, improve reliability, and accelerate feature delivery. <br>

<h2> Tools that could be used for this: </h2> <br>

1. GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket (Version Control & CI/CD Platform): <br>
2. Docker (Containerization): <br>
3. Jenkins / CircleCI / Travis CI (Dedicated CI/CD Servers - Alternative to built-in): <br>
4. npm / Yarn / Maven / Gradle (Package Managers & Build Tools): <br>
5. Jest / Mocha / JUnit / Pytest (Testing Frameworks): <br>
6. Terraform / Ansible / CloudFormation (Infrastructure as Code - IaC): <br>
7. Sentry / New Relic / Prometheus & Grafana (Monitoring & Logging):
